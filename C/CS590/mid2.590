Q#1 ( 10 pts)

a)  Write a C-program using nested-loops to produce the following output:

          1   1
          2   2   1
          3   3   2   1
          4   4   3   2   1
          5   5   4   3   2   1
          6   0

b)  Rewrite the while-loop with a for-loop:

     x = 14;
     while ( x >= 3)
        {
          printf("%i", x);
          x - = 5;
        }


Q#2  ( 12 pts)

Write C-program that uses function compute(), which is called-by-value by
the main(), passing an integer type one-dimensional array and number of
elements (size=n) as parameters. Your program can use n=15 or 20. Use
Top-down-design methodology. 

The function compute() does the following:
     a. minimum value in the array
     b. maximum value in the array
     c. sum of individual element values
     d. average value

After computing the above values, the function will print the values
within the function itself. 


Q#3 ( 8 pts)

Using global variables, write a C-program, which first declares, creates
an array (one-D), fills its elements with the value and then invokes a
function that returns the count of positive values, negative values and
number of elements having values equal to 0. Assume the array holds
integer type of data. 


Q#4 ( 8 pts)

Write a shell script that echoes the name of each one of the directory files.

e.g.:          Mail is a directory
          cs590projects is a directory
          ...........................


Q#5 ( 12 pts)

Write a C-program that adds up the digits of a non-negative number.
     e.g.:          number = 129   SumOfDigits of 129 = 12

Use the following algorithm:

     sum  < -- 0
     do the following
          place the rightmost digit of num into RightMostDigit
          add RightMostDigit to sum
          strip away the rightmost digit of num
     while num is positive
     return num
