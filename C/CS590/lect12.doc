  The UNIX Shell
  
  The UNIX operating system consists of two parts: the kernel and the utilities.
  
  --> The kernel is the heart of the UNIX system and is memory-resident
(which means that, it stays in the memory from the time you boot/start the
system until the system is shutdown). All the routines that communicate
directly with the hardware are concentrated in the kernel.
  ---> In addition to the kernel, other essential modules are also memory
resident. These modules perform important functions such as I/O control,
file management, memory management, process-time management, etc.
Additionally, UNIX maintains several memory-resident tables for
house-keeping purposes, to keep track of the system's status.
  --> The rest of the UNIX system resides on the disk and is loaded into
the memory ONLY when necessary. Most of the UNIX commands you know are
programs (utilities) that reside on the disk. For those programs, when the
user types a command (request the program to be executed), the specified
program is loaded into the memory. 
  
  The user communicates with the operating system through a shell, and
hardware-dependent operations are managed by the kernel.
  
  Shell itself is a program (or utility). It loads into memory whenever
you login to the system. When the shell is ready to receive commands, it
displays a prompt. The shell itself does not carry out most of the commands
that user types; it examines each command and starts the appropriate UNIX
program that carries out the requested action.
  
Shell determines what program to start (the name of the program is the
same as the command you type) or prompt 'command not found'. Shell also
contains several built-in commands. These commands are part of the shell
itself and are recognized & executed internally. (e.g. pwd, cd, cat, and
others).
  --> The standard UNIX system comes with more than 200 utility programs.
One of these is sh command, the shell itself!!
  
  Shell Major functions:
  
  Shell is a sophisticated program that manages the dialogue between the
user and the UNIX system. The shell is a regular executable C-program that
is usually stored in /bin directory.
  --> One of the most commonly used shell programs is Bourne shell; stored
under the name sh in the /bin directory. When you login, an interactive
Bourne shell is invoked automatically. However, you can invoke the shell
(another copy of it) by typing sh command.
  
  Shell includes the following major features:
  
1. Command execution:  Command (program) execution is a major function of
the shell. Just about anything you type at the prompt is interpreted by
the shell. When you press [Return] at the end of the command-line, the
shell starts analyzing your command; if there are filename substitution
characters, or I?O redirection signs, it takes care of them, and then
executes the appropriate program. 
  
2. Filename substitution: If filename substitution (also called as
filename generation) is specified on the command-line, then the shell
first performs the substitution and then executes the program. 
  
3.  I/O redirection: The input/output redirection is handled by the shell.
The redirection is setup before the command is executed. 
  
4. Pipes: Also called as pipelines, let you connect simple programs
together to perform a more complex task. The vertical line on the keyboard
[ | ] is the pipeline operator. 
  
5.  Environmental control: The shell lets you customize your environment
to suit your needs. By setting the appropiate variables, you may change
your home directory, prompt sign, or other aspects of working environment. 
  
6. Background processing: The background processing capability of the
shell enables you to run programs in the background, while doing other
jobs in the foreground. This is helpfil for time-consuming &
non-interactive programs. 
  
7. Shell scripts: Commonly used sequence of the shell commands can be
stored in files called shell scripts. The name of the file can later be
used to execute the stored program, enabling you to execuate the stored
commands with a single command!! Shell also includes language constructs
that allow you to build shell scripts that perform more complex jobs. 
  
  Some of the shell commands:
  
1. The echo command: User can use the echo command to display messahes. It
displays its arguments on the terminal/screen, the standard output device.
Without argumane it produces an empty line; and by default appends a new
line to the end of the output. 
  
2. The shell metacharacters have a special meanings to the shell. You can
override those by using some special characters, like: 
     * backslash [\]
     * single quotation mark [']
     * double quotation mark ["]
  
  Shell Variables: 
  
Shell variables are named items you set to values to control or customize
your UNIX environment. Two types of variables: environmental & local. 
  
Environmental Variables (EV): Also known as standard variables; have names
that are known to the system. EV are used to keep track of the essential
things and are usually defined by the System Manager.  
For example:  TERM = vt100 for terminal
  
Local Variables (LV): Theses are user-defined varibales. LV are entirely
under the user's control. You can define, change, or delete them as you
like. 
  
Use the set command, to find out what shell variables are set for your
shell to use. Important to note that, the names of the standard variables
on the left of the equal sign (=) are in UpperCase letters. This is not a
requirement. You can use all lowercase or mixture-cases for the variable
names. The right side of equal sign (=) is the value assigned to the
variable. You can assign characters, digits, and the underscore characters
in the variable name, but hte first letter MUST be a characters, and not a
digit!! 
  
  Use the unset command to remove an unwanted variable.
  
  Standard shell variables:
  
1. HOME:  When you login, shell assigns the full pathname of your home
directory to the variable HOME. The HOME variable is used by several UNIX
commands to locate the home directory. For example, the cd command with no
argument checks this variable to determine the pathname to the home
directory and then sets the system to your home directory. 
  
2.  IFS:  The Internal Field Separator (IFS) variable is set to a list of
characters that are interpretted by the shell as separators of
command-line elements (e.g.: ls -l). Other separator characters for IFS
are tab and [Return]. The IFS characters are invisible (non-printable)
characters. 
  
3.  MAIL:  The MAIL variable is set to the filename of the file that
receives your mail (mbox). Mail sent to you is stored in this file, and
shell periodically checks the contents of this file to notify you if there
is any mail. 
  
4. PATH:  The PATH variable is set to the directory names that the shell
searches for the location of the commands in the directory structure. 
  
5. PS1: The Prompt String 1 (PS1) variable is set to the string used as
your prompt sign. The Bourne shell primary prompt sign is set to dollar
sign ($). You can change the prompt to what you like by assigning a
character of choice to PS1. 
  
6. PS2: The Prompt String 2 (PS2) variable assigns the prompt sign that is
displayed whenever you press [Return] before completion of the
command-line and shell expects the rest of the command. 
  
7. CDPATH:  The CDPATH variable is set to a list of absolute pathnames,
similar to the PATH variable. 
  
8. SHELL:  The SHELL variable is set to the full pathname of your login
shell. 
  
9. TERM:     The TERM variable is set to your terminal type. (e.g.: TERM=vt100)
  
10. TZ: The TZ variable sets the time zone that you are in.
          (Usually, set by the SM)
  
  More UNIX Utilities:
  
1. The sleep command: Timing a delay - This command causes the process
execution to go to sleep for a specified number of seconds. 
  
2. The ps command: The process status command - You can use this command
to obtain the status of the active processes in the system. When used
without any options, it displays the following in 4 columns: 
     * PID : the process ID number
     * TTY: your terminal number that controls the process
     * TIME: time duration (in seconds) that your process is running
     * COMMAND: the name of the command
  
3. The nohup command: Keep on running command - When you logout, your
background processes are terminated. The nohup command causes your
background processes to be immune to terminating signals. 
  
4. The kill command: Terminating a process - Not all programs behave
normally all the time. A program might be stuck in an infinite loop or be
waiting for resources that are not available, making your process
hungUp!!, your printer spitting non-stop garbage prints, or your keyboard
may be lockedUP too!!!! UNIX provides with the kill command to terminate
the unwanted process (process is a running number) The kill command sends
a signal to the specified process. The signal is an integer number
indicating the kill type, and the process is identified by the process ID
number with ps command. 
  
5. The tee command: Splitting the output - You can see the output on the
screen as well as save it in a file for later reference with this command. 
  
6. The grep command: The global regular expression print command is used
for searching a pattern in a file or a list of files. 
  
7. The sort command: This command sorts the contents in the file into
alphabetical order
