  UNIX Graphical User Interface (GUI):
  
This discussion does not aim teach you how to use X-Windows or any other
GUIs. Nor addresses an indepth comparison of all UNIX GUIs available. -->
For that knowledge, you MUST rely on the training documentation offered by
the UNIX vendor, workshops & training programs, or on third-party books
devoted totally to a specific GUI, and on articles in magazines and
training videos & CD's. Bottom-line is, UNIX managers and users be aware
and make appropriate informed decisions about choosing, using , and
profiting from UNIX in their work environment. 
  
When you buy almost anyone's UNIX these days, you will get a GUI as a part
of the deal. When you buy Sun's SOLARIS, you will get OpenWindows; when
you buy NeXTStep, you will get NeXTStep GUI; when you buy A/UX, you will
get the A/UX Finder; and so on. The different flavors of UNIX and these
many versions of GUI are crucial on the basis of informed consent. It is
important to know the history of UNIX GUI's. Although you may little choice
or no choice-at-all, but to accept the GUI supplied with your version of
UNIX, you should at least know, what it might be missing! This knowledge
helps to develop a critical mindset so you can approach UNIX as though it
were any other operating system. 
  
A comparative knowledge of GUI's will also when you replace an existing
UNIX system or when your vendor decides to offer and support additional
GUIs you might consider installing (compatibility). 
  
It is easy to think of GUIs and say ''Mac or MicroSoft Windows on a PC".
Although the Mac and Windows may have popularized the term "GUI" for
legions of Mac/PC users, the graphical user interface have been around for
years on UNIX based computers, and now can be found improving virtually
all flavors of UNIX including SVR4 and BSD4.3
  
--> A UNIX GUI simplifies the use of computing environment. Click of a
mouse, drag-and-drop, iconized application folders and
programs................. With each UNIX GUI you can always pop-up a
terminal window that lets you issue UNIX commands directly to a shell. 
  
--> Typically, GUIs are customized on UNIX by special salent/hidden files
that you place in your home directory, along with calls to the specific
windowing system or GUI placed on your start-up files (e.g.: .profile,
.login, and/or .cshrc files). These special files have names like
.XTermDef and .MotifPref. 
  
--> GUI vendors will supply all the special hidden files you need, and
make the necessary modifications to your start-up files (like
configuration files) so their GUI fires up system start-up or whenever you
want to use it. 
  
  X-Windows: The foundation of UNIX GUIs:
  
UNIX GUIs consist of two basic types: (1) graphical environments that
provide users with built-in-graphical controls for all system functions;
and (2) graphical shells or windowing systems that provide graphical
controls of applications, but require that system settings be performed
through a shell window. In effect, they insulate the UNIX user from the
technical foundations of the operating system. 
  
Some products, such as Sun's OpenWindows, provide a full graphical
environment that can control and operate UNIX without the need to resort
to the shell. OpenWindows is built on the OpenLook graphical shell. The
Open Systems Foundation's Motif GUI(OSF/Motif), Apple's A/UX Finder, and
NeXTStep's NeXTStep GUI provide similar graphical environments. 
  
--> X Windows is both a graphical shell and the full windowing developer's
toolkit, with which many of UNIX GUIs have been created. 
  
--> The X Window System is a network-independent, operating
system-independent windowing system. It sits on top of different operating
systems (UNIX, Macintosh System 7.0, VAX VMS, OS/2, DOS, etc.), making it
a good product for mixed OS environments. 
  
--> With X Windows, system designers can apply consistent interface design
across a wide range of hardware, operating systems, and applications. 
  
--> X Windows was developed at MIT, and is available on Internet FREE!!
UNIX vendors include a copy of X Window as a part of their UNIX
distribution....... 
  
  X Window Servers and Clients:
  
An X server program typically lives on a UNIX computer to control screens,
keyboards, mouse, and other local devices. An X Window client is an
application program displayed on the server's window or windows. It does
not need to be running on the same computer, and the one it runs on may or
may not be a UNIX machine! X Window clients can be displayed on the same
UNIX machine as the X server, or the client and server can be separated
but connected over a UNIX network. 
  
--> In short, X supports multiple windows run by multiple applications
that send the inputs to these windows to various programs running locally
on your UNIX machine or over the network on another host computer. 
  
--> The X server is the most device-dependent portion of the system. X
servers have been written to run everything from micros to mainframes
using various operating systems, including UNIX. 
  
--> Client applications make requests of these X servers and direct the
server's use of bitmaps, cursors, fonts and windows.
