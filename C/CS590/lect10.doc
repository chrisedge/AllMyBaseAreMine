  Searching through files:
  
  1. Basic searches with grep command
  2. grep with multi-word strings
  3. Searching more than one file
  4. Searching for lines without a certain string
  
  --> Many people find that they want to search for a certain string of
text within a file, but they would prefer not to look at the entire file to
find it. 
  ---> grep is the answer to those worries!!!
  
  grep (global regular expression printer) searches through a file or
files for the string, or expression, that you specify.
  
  Basic searches with grep command:
  
  To search for a particular character string in a specified file, use the
grep command: 
  
          ace -> grep  cc cs590projects           <-- single pattern
  or      ace -> grep  a cs590projects          <-- more than one string
  or      ace -> grep qzhan vnorth wlamb
  
  Searching for more than one file: (a directory)
  
     ace -> pwd
     ace -> ls
     ace -> grep a *
  
  When you have a directory of files, and you want to search for a
specific string in all of them, type grep followed by *, the wild card
characters for a string of arbitrary length. 
  
  Searching for lines without a certain string: (files that don't contain
a certain string)
  
  --> use the -v option to grep command.
  e.g.:   ace -> grep -v k *       .......... files that don't contain letter k 
  
 Time Saving features:
  
     1. Aliases
     2. the History mechanism:     - command repetition & substitution
          - shorthand ways of typing many commands
     3. Running commands in the background
     4. A procedure to instruct the system to execute multiple
        command-lines at the same time.........
  
  Time saving features can make your work quicker and easier.
  
  1. You can use alias command to develop a shorthand for commands that
you type frequently. Since you probably type the logout command (presume
that not using ^D) every time you end your work session, you can use an
abbreviated command. 
  
     ace ->  alias lo logout
     ace -> lo
     c:\>
  
--> When you type the lo alias for the logout command, the system
interprets it as if you had typed logout, and logs you out!!
  
2. The UNIX environment (SunOS) stores the commands you type using a
history mechanism. You can reuse the commands you have typed with command
repetition and command substitution.
  
1. Command Repetition: Allows you to repeat previous command lines or
parts of previous command lines.The two most common commands are: !! and !$
  
  !! repeats the entire last command line you entered.
  
     ace -> ls
          ... displays the directory............. 
     ace -> !!
          ... the directory is displayed,again................
  
  !$ repeats the last word on the previous command line.
  
You can type both !! and !$ anywhere in the current command-line to repeat
all or a portion of the previous line.
  
2. Command Substitution: Sometimes you may want to repeat a previous
command-line, but change a portion of it, perhaps to correct a mistake or
to complete a repetitive task. Command substitution, a basic form of
command editing, is useful for such corrections and tasks.
  
  For example, when you want to make a directory called animals, you
should type mkdir animals. But, if you make a mistake, you can correct your
mistake with the command substitution symbols, ^ ^, the hat/caret characters.
  
     ace -> mdkir animals
     mdkir: Command not found
     ace -> ^dk^kd
     mkdir animals
     ace -> ls
     News  animals
     ace ->
  
  --> You can successfully correct the error with command substitution,
and the system makes the directory animals.
  
  --> To use the command substitution for repetitive tasks, consider that
you may want to make 4-5 directories. You already have animals directory.
Here is an easy way to create the rest of them.................
  
     ace -> mkdir plants
     ace -> ^plants^algi
     ace -> ^algi^fungi
     ace -> ^fungi^protistans
     ace -> ls
     News animals  plants
     algi fungi     protistans
  
  3. Running Commands in the Background:
  
  Another way to save your time is by running commands in the background,
one aspect of job control. In fact, you can run several commands in the
background at once.
  
  To run a command in the background, type the ampersand character &, at
the end of the command-line.
  
     ace ->    spell project2a.c > project2a.err  &
