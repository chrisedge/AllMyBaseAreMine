  UNIX LAN's:
  
A UNIX local area network (LAN) can be configured in several different
ways, and most versions of UNIX (including SVR4, or BSD4) can support all
kinds of networking protocol suites and physical networking layers. 
  
SVR4 (AT&T), BSD4.3(SunOS), and other UNIX versions include a number of
built-in programs and facilities for networking stand-alone UNIX
workstations and PC's. Many networking vendors offer software compatible
with each versions and streams(flexible communication paths between UNIX
processes). 
  
BSD4.3 includes TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol)
suite of networking protocols, running over Ethernet networks. TCP/IP
supports: telnet software, ftp(file transfer protocol) and tftp(trivial
file transfer protocol) software and other networking services. 
  
To this basic set of TCP/IP protocols, many UNIX vendors have added Sun's
Networked File System (NFS), which distributes UNIX files across UNIX
nodes on the network. 
  
Nevertheless, UNIX networks do not have to be based on Ethernet, TCP/IP ,
or NFS. They can be based on just about any networking physical layers and
topologies, networking protocols and operating systems (Novell
Netware/AppleTalk), or even competing shared-file system software (AT&T
RFS). However, all UNIX LANs do typically conform to a set of networking
standards that have been agreed upon by the International Standards
Organization (ISO). 
  
  What are your customization goals?
  
  Startup files:    -  .profile, .cshrc, and .login files
  
Regardless of which version of UNIX you are running, you will also use one
of the popular UNIX shell. Each shell supports a set of hidden startup
files that perform special customization and preference functions for your
login account, each time you login. These files begin with a dot (.) in
your directory listing when you use ls -a command. 
  
If you use the Bourne shell (mostly under SVR4-AT&T), then a default
.profile hidden file was created for you with your UNIX login account.
This hidden file contains commands that are executed at start-up (also
called as startup script) to provide a particular UNIX environment. The
default .profile will ultimately suite no one, although it's likely to be
relatively innocuous. You will need to edit this text file to make it
conform to your needs. The same holds true for the start-up file used by
the C-shell (BSD4.3-Berkley), called .cshrc and .login files.  (Note: Your
SM has already provided the best start-up files for you in Morton!!)
  
--> To understand how your current startup files affect your UNIX
environment, type the print environment command: printenv and
see............... 
  
--> Because UNIX is so powerful and so malleable, the best customization
strategy is one based on moving-with-caution. Try out one change at a time
to a startup file script (the list of commands found in any .login,
.cshrc, or .profile file), or a shell variable (TERM, PS!, or printer..)
or an environmental variable and see the difference!! 
  
  C-shell start-up files:
  
The C-shell, csh , is a command interpreter based on a command-line
interface with a syntax reminiscent of the C-language. It provides a
number of convenient features for interactive use that are not available
with the standard SVR4 (Bourne) shell, including filename completion,
command aliasing, history substitution, job control, and a number of
built-in commands. Like the standard Bourne shell (sh), the C-shell
provides variable, command, and filename substitution. 
  
What should go into the .login and .cshrc startup files has been the
subject of much debate among UNIX experts, but, usually you place commands
and definitions that will affect your entire C-shell in the .cshrc file.
You place commands and definitions that affect your specific UNIX hardware
in the .login file. The keyboard mappings and the screen characteristics,
including whether or not a GUI or windowing system might be invoked at
login, are especially important. 
  
  Bourne shell startup files:
  
The most common customization file for SVR4 users is .profile file. Use
cat .profile to see the list of commands in that file on the screen.
Common commands are: umask, stty and biff. 
  
The umask command:  It sets up the default file permissions for newly
created files. umask applies to all files and directories created by the
user, whether in their home directory or not. (e.g.: umask 002 or umask
022)
  
If you later need to change the permission for a specific file, use chmod
command. 
  
The stty command: This command sets up special terminal control characters
for the particular kind of workstation monitor, or computer screen, or
minicomputer/PC and keyboard you are using. This goes with setting Ctrl-H
or D operations. For example, enter stty erase ^H for the same action of
Ctrl-H (^H or ^D). 
  
The biff command: Another command that you may want to add to your startup
file is to tell you when a new electronic mail has been received. - alerts
you of the incoming mail even during your work/process. To turn this
command off, type biff n. 
  
To keep you from blowing away an important file, the C-shell provides a
variable called noclobber. Simply set it with set noclobber command in
your .cshrc file. This prevents you from accidental erases or overwriting
any output on to an existing file, although you may still append to an
existing file. 
  
UNIX pipes are interprocess communication channels that both users and the
system can control. Pipes connect any two UNIX commands so that the output
from one feeds directly into the input of the other. A pipe is represented
by a vertical bar (|). 
  
A filter is any UNIX command setup in which one command or program takes
its input directly from another program - linked commands or actions.
