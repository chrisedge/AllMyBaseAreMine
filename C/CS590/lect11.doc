C Shell Scripts
  
Scripts are nothing but a sequence of UNIX system commands. By using the
source filename command, or by setting the execute permissions and typing
the filename (as if it were a command), user can tell the C shell to read &
perform commands in that file.
  
  NOTE: Every system Reference Manual recommends the use of Bourne shell
for writing shell scripts. The Bourne shell has a simpler command syntax,
faster execution time, and provides better security.
  
C shell scripts do not serve the same function as make, which is useful
for consistently performining a set of operations on related files. C shell
is more general in scope. Scripts do not check for dependencies. However,
you can do many things with scripts, such as prompting for input from the
terminal, that are not practical using make.
  
  When a script is invoked by name, the system looks at the very first
line of the file to decide how to run it:
     *  If the first line of the script starts with a #!, followed by the
name of the program, the system uses that program to perform commands in
the script.
     *  If the first line starts with a # (hash sign), the system then
uses the C shell to run the script
     *  If the first line does not start with a # (hash sign), the system
uses the Bourne shell to run the script.
  
  C shell Invocation:
  
  To run a script with no C shell startup processing, the first line
should be of the form: 
     #!  csh  -f  script
  
To pass a commd-line argument as parameters to a script, type its name,
followed by any arguments you wish. The C shell places words following the
name in the variable argv, the argument list. Command-line arguments are
treated as words contained in this variable, or you can use the equivalent
variables: $1 through $n, where n is the number of arguments in the list.
  
  Variables in scripts:
  
  A number of notations are available for accessing words in a variable,
and other variable attributes.  
  
  --> The notation $?name expands to 1, if a named variable exists (using
the set command), or to 0 otherwise.
  
     ace -> set var=(a b c)
     ace -> echo $?var
     1
     ace -> unset var
     ace -> echo $?var
     0
  
  All other forms of reference to undefined variables cause errors.
  
  --> The notation $#name expands to the count of words in the variable
name: 
  
     ace -> set var=(a b c)
     ace -> echo $#var
     3
     ace -> unset var
     ace -> echo $#var
     var: Undefined variable.
  
  Expressions:
  
  All of the arithmetic operations of the C language are available in the
C shell with the same operator precedence (priority & left-to-right
evaluation). Even the operations == and != for comparing, and the && and ||
implement the logical and and or operations, respectively. 
  
  File enquiries:
  
  The expression -e <filename> returns 1 if the file exists, and 0
otherwise. Similar primitives ( -options) provide other test:
     -r  1     if read-access is allowed for the user running the script
     -w  1     if write-access is allowed for the user
     -x  1     if execute-access is allowed
     -0  1     if the user owns the file
     -z  1     if the file has zero length
     -f  1     if it is an ordinary file
     -d  1     if it is a directory file
  
  Pathname processing Primitives:
  
  There are few primitives user can apply to pathnames to strip-off
un-needed components: 
  
     :t (tail) removes all but the rightmost component (or basename) of
the pathname
     :r (root) removes suffixes begining with a dot (.)
     :e (end) removes prefixes ending with a dot.
     :h (head) removes the last component, leaving the pathname of the
directory in which the file resides.
  ** Try some of these and see with pwd command!!!
  
  Return Codes:
  
  It is possible to test whether a command terminates normally by using a
primitive of the form { command }, which returns 1, if the command exists
normally (with exit status 0), or 0 if the command terminates abnormally
(with a nonzero return code!!).
  
  --> Since every command returns a value to status, you MUST save values
of interest on the very next line of the script.
  
     set checkpoint=$status   .........where checkpoint is the variable name
  
  Sample C shell script:      
  
  The following script , copyc, copies files named as arguments into a
backup directory: 
  
  #
  #  copyc copies files named on the command line to the directory
  #  ~ /backup if they differ from the files already in  ~ /backup
  #
  set noglob
  foreach i ($argv)
  
     if  ($i  !~ *.c)  continue              # not a  .c file, do nothing
  
     if  (! -r  ~/backup/$i:t) then
          echo $i:t not in backup..........  not cp\ ed
          continue
     endif
  
     cmp  -s $i  ~/backup/$i:t               #to set $status
  
     if  ($status != 0)  then
          echo new backup of $i
          cp $i  ~/backup/$i:t
     endif
  end
  
  The above script uses the foreach command, which causes the C shell to
execute the command between it and the corresponding end with the named
variable taking on each of the values given between (and). The named
variable- in this case, i - is set to successive words in the list. Within
this loop you can use the break command to stop executing the loop or
continue to terminate one iteration and begin another. After the foreach
loop, the iteration variable (i in this case) has the value it had during
the last iteration. The varibale noglob is set to prevent filename
expansion from being performed
