  Treasure of UNIX related Questions & Answers...................
  
Q1. What are some of the features that distinguish the C-shell from the
Bourne shell? 
  
A.  The C-shell has a history facility, by which you can recall command
lines that were previously executed. You can then repeat those command
lines or modify them and execute the modified version. In addition,
C-shell provides a job control capability that gives the user the ability
to exert more control over his/her background processes. 
  
Q2.  What is the command that you can use to change your default shell?
Where is the C-shell usually found on UNIX systems? 
  
A.  The command used to change your default shell is: chsh. To use this,
you give it a single argument, which is the pathname of the shell that you
want to have as your new default. On most systems, the C-shell is in
/bin/csh (Typically BSD) or /usr/bin/csh (Typically SVR4). 
  
Q3.  How can you quickly repeat the last command that you entered?
  
A.  The quickway to do that is with the history recall of !!. All history
substitutions begin with the exclamation, or bang, character (!), and the
second exclamation mark is a short hand for the previous command. 
  
Q4.  How can you make a quick change of one word of the last command and
rerun it?
  
A.  The substitution character is the caret (^). Enclose first the string
you want to change in carats, followed by the string to replace it with,
and a closing carat (e.g.: ^change_this^to_that^). The first occurence of
the search string will then be replaced by the second, and the resulting
command-line will then be executed. 
   
Q5. What is the difference between the use of the semicolon (;) and the
pipe (|) as separators between commands? 
  
A:  The semicolon metacharacter connects sequentially executed commands,
permitting you to enter more than one command on a line. It is also used
within the parentheses metacharacters as a separator. There is no direct
interaction between one command and the next when the semicolon is used as
a separator. 
  
       The pipe metacharacter establishes a connection between two
commands, where the output of the first command becomes the input to the
second command. The two commands run concurrently, as opposed to
sequentially as with the semicolon metacharacter.
  
  Q6.  How do you place a command in background?
  
  A.    Any command can be executed in background simply by ending the command-
  line with the ampersand (&) metacharacter. This indicates the C-shell that the
  command should be processed in background. Not all commands are good for
  background processing. Any command that requires input from stdin or output to
  stdout will stop when input is needed and will output information back
to the screen, as it is running. To avoid these problems, use file
redirection, with < for input and >
  for output, to give the command alternates for stdin & stdout.
  
  Q7.  Why are files that begin with a dot (.), salient or hidden, not
found with the asterik (*) metacharacter?
  
A.  Because hidden files or the dot files are rarely of interest and
frequently cause problems when included on a command-line and processed by
a command, the asterik metacharacter excludes matching the dot so that
they are not part of the expansion. If you need or want to have these
files on a command-line or in a directory list, use the expression .??* to
get all but the files dot (.) and dot dot (..)
  
  Q8.   Where should aliases be placed?
  
A.  Aliases should be put in your .cshrc startup file. Because they are
not passeed on from one shell to the next, they need to be re-created for
each shell that is started. The .cshrc file is read by each shell when it
starts, so this is where you should put your aliases, letting each shell
get a copy. 
  
  Q9.  How can you find out what aliases have already defined?
  
A.  Using the alias command by itself with no arguments displays a list of
all of your current aliases. You may want to pipe the output from the
alias command with more command, if you have many aliases defined. 
  
Q10.  When you define an alias, how can you include all of the arguments
from the command-line in your alias? 
  
A.  When you create an alias that will require substituting arguments from
the command-line, you can place the metacharacters !* at the point in the
alias where you want the parameters to be inserted. Be sure to remember,
to escape the exclamation character with a backslash. 
  
  Q11.  What is the difference between local and environment variables?
  
A.  Local variables affect only the shell in which they are defined. On
the contrary, Environment variables are passed on to all shells, commands,
and scripts that are started from the shell in which they are defined. 
  
  Q12.   How does the shell identify variables?
  
A.  Shell variables, both local and environment (global), begin their
names with a dollar sign ($). There is no way to know whether a variable
is local or global, other than by seeing which command displays its name
and value--set (for local variables) or setenv (for global variables).
Just to make the convention simpler & easier, use all uppercase letters in
environment variables. 
  
  Q13.  Do the C-shell's built-in switch variables take on values?
  
A.  The answer is no. These variables have only 2 values ON/OFF or
TRUE/False, meaning either exist or are set, or erased/deleted/ or unset. 
  
Q14.  Is there a specific command used for assigning expression results to
variables in the C-shell? 
  
A.  The set command can be used for assigning constant values or the
contents of another variable to a shell variable. If you want to need to
assign the results of an expression, use the C-shell @ command to make the
assignment. 
  
Q15.  How can you protect yourself from inadvertently terminating your
login shell session? 
  
A.  The special built-in shell variable $ignoreeof acts as a switch to
cancel the effect of the EOF character (Ctrl-D or ^D), from terminating
any C-shell that is running. Setting this variable in your .login startup
file will ensure that you can terminate your login shell ONLY with the
exit command and not with ^D. 
  
Q16.  What are the names of the C-shell startup files and how are they
used by the shell? 
  
A.  The C-shell has 2 official startup files, namely .cshrc and .login -
The .cshrc file is read by any new C-shell process to set the environment
for that shell. It typically contains alias definitions and local variable
initializations. It can also contain environment variable setups as well.
The .login file is read and processed by the user's login shell only at
the start of a session. It typically contains environment variable (global)
initializations as well as UNIX commands to setup terminal attributes. 
  
  Q17.  How can you change the format of your C-shell command prompt?
  
A.  The C-shell built-in variable $prompt contains the template for
formatting the shell prompt. 
  
Q18.  How can you set a default terminal type, but be prompted with the
option of overriding this default at login? 
  
A.  When you include the tset command in the .login startup file, it can
establish a default terminal type (e.g.: vt100) as well as a prompt the
user at login to change the type. The user can press [Return] to accept
the default or override it with a valid terminal type. 
  
  Q19.  What do you do to indicate that you want file redirection?
  
A.  For the simplest form, you can use the metacharacters < and > to
indicate input and output file redirections, respectively. Each of these
metacharacters is followed by a filename that will be used for the source
of input or destination of output. 
  
Q20.  How would you append output to a file rather than overwrite it with file
redirection?
  
A.  The special metacharacter pair >> is used to append output to a file.
The file MUST exist before the redirection operation. 
  
Q21.  If you have set the $noclobber shell variable, how do you override
it to redirect output to a file without an error? 
  
A.  By adding an exclamation mark metacharacter (!) to any output
file-redirection operator, you can specify that you want to override the
effect of the $noclobber variable (e.g.: use >! or >>!). 
  
  Q22.  What is the difference between exit and logout?
  
A.  The exit command will pass a return value back to the calling process,
as specified by the expression on the command-line. The exit command will
always end a shell process, while logout is only valid for a login shell.
More importantly, logout works ONLY with the login shell. 
  
Q23.  Why have a separate command login, when exec /usr/bin/login will do
the same thing? 
  
A.  The login command is shorter to type, and login also allows you to
pass your current environment to the new login environment with the -p
option. 
  
Q24.  When you have started a long command, and you intend to put it in
the background, how can you do that? 
  
A.  First, type Control-Z (^Z) at the terminal. This will suspend
execution of the process without deleting the work done. Then type bg to
place the process in the background. 
  
  Q25.  How will you know, when the process is complete?
  
A.  When you finish a command and a prompt is about to be issued, the
C-shell will check to see if any jobs have changed their status. If so,
will be notified. If you need immediate feedback, you can either set the
notify variable or use the notify command to indicate that a process should
notify you on status changes asynchronously.
  
  Q26.  What steps are required for building a large project?
  
A.  First, the problem needs to be clear. This allows a clean design and
the breaking down of the problem into simpler tasks. Then, you solve each
task separately, and finally you integrate the pieces into a complete
program (That is Top-Down Design methodology...)
  
  Q27.  How is the source command used for integration?
  
A.  The source command allows the integrator to use each piece separately,
and it avoids the problems of combining the pieces before testing. It also
quick changes to each piece, without disrupting the whole testing process. 
  
Q28.  When you get a message on the screen that says' There are stopped
jobs...'. What does this mean? 
  
A.  You have attempted to exit the C-shell while some of the jobs
(programs) you were running were stopped. You should examine these jobs,
using the jobs command, and either resume or kill the job before you exit
the shell. 
  
Q29.  You have a job that has the status: Stopped (tty input). How do you
fix this? 
  
A.  Check the job number. If it has a +, just type fg and the job will
become the foreground job. Otherwise, type fg %number to bring the job to
the foreground. 
  
Q30.  How can you see the commands as they are run, when you run a C-shell
script? 
  
A.  Use -v option. Run the script like this:  csh -v scriptname. Each
command is printed/displayed after variable expansion, but, before it is
executed.
