  Exploring shell programming:
  
Comments:  Documentation is important while writing computer programs, and
writing a shell script is no exception. Documentation is essential to
explain the purpose and logic of the program, and variables used.  
-- the shell recognizes # as the comment symbol; therefore, characters
after the # symbol are ignored during execution of the script. 
  
Variables:  Like other programming languages, the UNIX shell also lets you
create variables to store values.  e.g.:  variable=value count=1,
header="Menu" 
--> Important Note:  spaces are not permitted on either side
of the equal sign. 
  
Command-line parameters:  The shell scripts can read upto ten command line
parameters (arguments) from the command-line into the special variables
(also called as positional variables). Command-line arguments are the
items you type after the command, usually separated by spaces. These
arguments are passed to the program and change the behavior of the program
or make it act in a specific order. The special variables are numbered in
sequence from 0 to 9 (no number 10) and are named $0, $1, #2, and so on. 
  
  List of special (positional) variables:
  
        Variable              Meaning
  
     $0        Contains the name of the script, as typed on the command-line
     $1, $2, ...$9  Contains the first through ninth command-line parameters
     $#        Contains the number of command-line parameters
     $@        Contains all command-line parameters: "$1" "$2"......"$9"
     $?        Contains exit status of the last command
     $*        Contains all command-line parameters: "$1 $2 $3.........$9"
     $$        Contains the PID number of the executing process
  
Conditions & Tests:  You can specify that certain commands be executed
depending on the result of other commands' execution. Every command
executed in the UNIX system returns a number (event number) that you can
test to control the flow of your program. A command either a 0, which
means success (condition being TRUE), or it returns any other number,
which indicates failure(condition to be FALSE). These true and false
conditions are used in the shell programming constructs and are tested to
determine the flow of the program. (e.g.: if-then, elif-then, else, fi
commands or case/esac command)
  
test command (True/False):  The test command is a built-in shell command
that evaluates the expression given to it as an argument and returns true,
if the expression is true (returns 0), or, otherwise, false (returns a
non-zero). 
  
  The test command numeric test operators:
  
  Operator     Example             Meaning
  -eq          num1 -eq num2  is num1 equal to num2?
  -ne          num1 -ne num2  is num1 not equal to num2?
  -gt          num1 -gt num2  is num1 greater than num2?
  -ge          num1 -ge num2  is num1 greater than equal to num2?
  -lt          num1 -lt num2       is num1 less than num2?  
  -le          num1 -le num2  is num1 less than or equal to num2?
  
  The logical operators are as follows:
  
* Logical and operator (-a): The test command returns 0 (condition code
true) if both expressions are true.  
* Logical or operator (-o): The test
command returns 0 (condition code true) if one or both expressions are
true.  
* Logical not operator (!): The test command returns 0 (condition
code true), if the expression is false. 
  
  The test command string test operators:
  
  Operator          Example        Meaning
  
  =       string1 = string2   Does string1 match string2?
  !=      string1 != string2  Does string1 not match string2?
  -n      -n string           Does string contain characters?
                         	(non-zero length)
  -z      -z string      is string an empty string? (zero length)
  
  The test command file test operators:
  
  Operator     Example        Meaning
  -r      -r filename    Does filename exist and is it readable?
  -w      -w filename    Does filename exist and is it writable?
  -s      -s filename    Does filename exist and have a non-zero length?
  -f      -f filename    Does filename exist, but is not a directory file?
  -d      -d filename    Does filename exist and is it a directory file?   
  
Parameter substitution:  The shell provides a parameter substitution
facility that lets you test the value of a parameter and change its value
according to a specified option. This is useful is shell programming, when
you want to check whether a variable is set to something. 

--> The format consists of a dollar sign ($), a set of braces ({ }), a
variable, a colon (:)an option character, and a word, as follows: 
     ${parameter:option character word} 
--> An option character determines
what you intend to do with the word. The 4 option characters are specified
by -, =, ?, and + signs. These 4 options perform differently depending on
whether the variable is an empty variable. 
  
e.g: Suppose you want to change the nature of file called memo, specified
in the variable called FILE, to memoX.
  
  1. ${parameter}
     $echo $FILE [Return]               .. check what is stored in FILE
     memo
  
     $mv $FILE  ${FILE}X [Return]  .. change memo to to memoX
     $_                       .. Job done, prompt is back!!
  
  2. ${parameter:+word}
     $ HELP= "wanted" {Return]          .. set HELP variable
     $echo  ${HELP:+"Help is under way!!"} [Return]
     Help is under way!!
     $echo $HELP [Return]          .. check the help variable
     wanted                        .. it remained the same
     $_                       done, prompt is back..........
  
Loop constructs:  You use the loop constructs in programs when you want to
repeat a set of statements or commands. The loop constructs save a lot of
time for you. The shell provides 3 looping constructs: for-loop,
while-loop and until-loop. 
  
  1. The for-loop: The for-in-done construct: 
The for-loop is used to execute a set of commands for a specified number of
times: The basic format is: 
     for variable
     in list-of-values
     do
          commands
           ..........
          last command
     done
  
  e.g.:   $for count in 1 2 3 [Return]
     >do [Return]
     >echo "In the loop for $count times" [Return]
     >done
  
  2. The while-loop: The while-do-done construct: Unlike the for-loop,
whose number of iterations/repetitions depends on the the number of values
in the list of values, the while-loop continues as long as the loop
condition is true. The format as given below: 
     while [condition]
     do
          commands
          .........
          last command
     done
  
  3. The until-loop: The until-do-done construct: The until-loop is
similar to the while-loop, except that it continues executing the body of
the loop as long as the condition of the loop is false (non-zero). The
until-loop is useful in writing scripts whose execution depends on other
events occuring. 
     until [condition]
     do
          commands
          ............
          last command
     done
  
Debugging shell programs/scripts:
  
You can use the sh command with one of its options to make the debugging
of your script files easier. The sh command options are: 
  
  Option            Operation
  
  -n      reads commands but does not execute then
  -v      shows the shell input lines as they are read
  -x      shows the commands and their arguments as they are executed
          (the trace of your script execution/echo each command as executed)              

UNIX Programming Utilities:
  
It is important to note that, UNIX provides you with utilities to help you
organize your program development process. These utilities become
especially useful and important when you are developing large-scale
software. 
  
1. Language compilers: FORTRAN, Pascal, C 
2. The make utility:  This
utility is useful when your program is comprised of more than one file.
make automatically keeps track of the source files that are changed and
need re-compilation, and relinks your programs if required. The make
program gets its information from a control file. The control file
contains rules that specify source file dependencies and other
information. 
3. The SCCS Utility: The SCCS(Source Code Control System) is
a collection of programs that helps you to maintain and manage the
development of your program. If your program is under SCCS control, then
you can create different versions of your program easily. The SCCS keeps
track of all the changes among different versions. 
  
  UNIX Internals: The signals:
  
How do you terminate a process? The answer is, you terminate a process by
generating an interrupt signal. A 'signal' is a report to your process
about a specific condition. For example, [Del], [Break], and [^C] are used
to send an interrupt signal to a process, so it terminates. Some of the
shell signals are: 
  
  Signal# Name      Meaning
  
  1       hang up   Terminal connection is lost
  2       interrupt One of the interrupt key is pressed
                    (e.g.: [Ctrl-C], [Del] or [Break] keys)
  3       quit      One of the quit key is pressed (e.g.: [Ctrl-\]
          ** This causes the process to 'core dump' before it terminates.......
  9       kill      The kill -9 command is issued
  15      terminator     The kill command is issued
  
Trapping the signals: The trap command
  
The default action taken by your process when it receives any of the
signals is immediate termination. You can use the trap command to change
the process default action to whatever you specify. The format is: 
     trap 'optional commands' signal numbers
  --> The commands that are specified to the trap command MUST be enclosed in
  single or double quotation marks. 
--> You can specify more than one
signal number to be trapped. The signal numbers are the numbers associated
with the signals that you want the trap command to catch. 
  e.g.:   trap "echo I refuse to do my homework!" 15
  
Resetting the traps:
  
Issuing the trap command in your script changes the default actions of the
signals received by your process. Using the trap command, without the
optional commands part, changes the specified signals to their default
actions. 
  e.g.: If you type the following command in your script file:
     $trap " " 2 3 15
     the interrupt, quit, and kill commands are ignored.
     If you type:
     $trap 2 3 15 
the specified signals are reset. That is to say, the
interrupt, quit, and kill keys are restored. 
  
Setting terminal options: The stty command
  
Use the stty command to set and display terminal characteristics. You can
control various characteristics of your terminal, such as the baud rate
(rate of transmission between the terminal and the computer), and the
functions of certain keys (interrupt, quit, kill etc). The stty command
without arguments shows a selected group of settings. Use -a option to
list all of your terminal settings. 
  
  A short list of terminal options
  
  Option            Operation
  
  echo [-echo] 	  Echoes [does not echo] the typed characters, default being
		   echo
  raw [-raw]        Disables [enables] the special meaning of the metacharacters.
               ( default is -raw)
  intr            Generates an interrupt signal, usually the [Del] key is used
  erase             (backspace) erases the preceeding character.
               (usually [#] key is used)
  kill              Deletes the entire line, usually [@] or [Ctrl-u] is used
  eof               Generates the EOF (end-of-file) signal from terminal
               (usually [Ctrl-d] is used
  ek           Resets the erase and kill keys to [#] and [@] respectively
  sane           sets the terminal characteristics to sensible default values
  
The terminal database: The terminfo file
  
Each terminal supported in your system has an entry in the terminal
database (file) called terminfo file. The terminfo database is a single
text file that contains descriptions of many types of terminals. For each
terminal in the database, there is a list of capabilities associated with
that terminal. 
  
Setting the Terminal capabilities: The tput command
  
The tput utility, which is standard on any system with the terminfo
database, lets you print out the values of any single capability. This
makes it possible to use terminals' capabilities in shell programming. 
     e.g.:     $tput clear [Return]          .. clears the screen
  You can override the default TERM shell variable with -T option.
  
  A short list of terminal capabilities
  
  Option            Operation
  
  bell         Echoes the terminal's bell character
  blink        Makes blinking display
  bold         Makes bold display
  clear        Clears the screen
  cup rc       Moves cursor to the row r and column c
  dim          Dims the display
  ed      Clears from the cursor position to the end of the screen
  el      Clears from the cursor position at the end of the line
  smso         Starts stand out mode
  rmso         Ends stand out mode
  smul         Starts underline mode
  rmul         Ends underline mode
  rev          Shows reverse video, black on white display
  
  --> Usually when you start a mode, it remains in effect until you remove it.
  --> You can store the character sequences in variables and then use the
	variables. 
  
  e.g.:   $tput clear [Return]          .. clears the screen
     $tput cup 10 20 [Return] .. positions the cursor
     $echo "The Terminfo Database" [Return]  .... displays the message
     $bell='tput bel' [Return]     .. stores the character sequence for bell
  
                
  UNIX Process Management:
  
In order to keep track of the processes in the system, UNIX creates and
maintains a process table for each process in the system. The process
table (PT) contains the following information: 
     * Process number
     * Process status (ready/waiting)
     * Event number process is waiting for
     * System data area address
  
A process is created by a system routine called fork (fork() ). A running
process calls fork, and in response UNIX duplicates that process, creating
two identical copies. The process that calls the fork routine is called
parent, and the copy of the parent created by fork is called child. UNIX
differentiates between the parent and child by giving them different
process ID's (PIDs). 
  
  The following steps are involved in managing a process:
  
* The parent calls fork, thus starts the process.  
* Calling fork is a system call. UNIX gets control, and the address of the
calling process is recorded in the process table's system data area (called
as return address), so the parent process knows where to start later when
it gets control again.  
* fork duplicates (copies) the process and control returns
to parent. 
* The parent receives the PID of the child, a positive integer
number, and child receives the return code 0. (A negative code means an
error!!) 
* The parent receiving a positive PID calls another system
routine called wait and goes to sleep. Now the parent is waiting for the
child process to finish (in UNIX terminology, waiting for the child to
die...) 
* The child process gets control and begins to execute. It checks
the return code; because the return code is 0, the child process calls
another system routine called exec (exec() ). The exec routine responds by
overlaying the child process area with the new program. 
* The new program's first instruction is executed. When the new program
gets to the end of the instruction, it calls yet another system routine
called exit, and thus the child process terminates/dies. The death of the
child awakens the parent, and the parent process takes over... 
  
  Some goody goody UNIX stuff:
  
  1. Finding available disk space: The df command You can use the df (disk
free) command to find the total amount of disk space or the space
available on a specified file system. Using the -t option makes the df
include the total number of blocks in the file system in the output. 
  
  2. Summarizing Disk Usuage: The du command You can use the du (disk
usage) command to obtain a report that includes each directory in the
file system, the number of blocks used by the files in that directory, and
its subdirectories. The du command options: 
  
  Option            Operation
  
  -a      Displays the directories and file sizes
  -s      Displays only the total blocks for the specified directory; subdirectories
  are not listed.
  
  3. Finding files: The find command You can use the find command to
locate files that match a given set of criteria in a hierarchy of
directories. The criterion may be a filename or a specified property of a
file (such as its modification date, size or type). The find command
search options: 
  
  Option            Description
  
  -name filename    Finds files with the given filename
  size +-n          Finds files with the size n
  -type filetype         Finds files with the specified access mode
  -atime+-n         Finds files that were accessed n days ago
  -mtime +-n        Finds files that were modified n days ago
  -newer filename   Finds files that were modified more recently than filename
  
  The +n notation is the above table is a decimal number that can be
specified as +n (meaning more than n) or -n( meaning less than n) or n
(meaning exactly n).
  
  4. Displaying the end-of-a-file: The tail command You can use the tail
command to display the last part (the tail end) of a specified file. The
tail gives you a quick way to check the contents of a file. The tail
command options: 
  
  Option       Operation
  
  b       This option causes tail to count by blocks
  c       This option causes the tail to count by characters
  l       This option causes the tail to count by lines
  
  5. Displaying Banners: The banner command
  
You can use the banner command to produce output in large letters. It
displays its arguments (10 characters or less) on the standard output, one
argument per line. This is useful to create banners, signs, report titles,
etc. 
  
  6. Running commands at a later time: The at command
  
You use the at command to run a command or list of commands at a later
time. You can specify the time and date part of the command in various
formats. 
  
  e.g.:   $at 1445 Tues [Return]
     $ at 0930 am Sep 18 [Return]       or    $at 11:10 am tomorrow [Return]
  
  7. Spelling error: The spell command
  
You can use the spell command to check the spelling of the words in your
document. The spell command compares the words in a specified file against
a dictionary (US English) file. 
  e.g.:   $spell [Return]               ... No argument specified
     looking good             .. input is from keyboard
     ^D
     looking good
     $_                  .. and the prompt is back
  
  or
     $spell my_doc > bad_words [Return]      .. spell check my_doc
  
  
  
  UNIX Security:
  
Information and computer time are valuable that require protection. System
security is a very important part of multiuser systems. There are various
aspects of system security to consider: 
    * keeping unauthorized people from gaining access to the file system
    * keeping an authorized user from tempering with the system files or
other user files
    * granting some users with certain privileges
  
  Security on the UNIX system is implemented by using simple commands, and the
  system security can be as lax or tight as you desire. Most important of
all are: 
  
     1. Password security
     2. File security
     3. Directory permissions - read/write/execute
     4. File encryption - crypt (encode/decode)
