From RFC 1034:
RRs contain the following:
owner	The domain name where the RR is found

type	Encoded 16 bit value that specifies the type of resource
	in the RR. Types refer to abstract resources. Types:

	A	a host address
	CNAME	alias
	HINFO	the cpu and OS of the host
	MX	mail exchanger for the domain (RFC 974)
	NS	authoritative name server for the domain
	PTR	pointer to another part of the domain space (in-addr.arpa)
	SOA	start of authority for a zone
	
class	Encoded 16 bit value that identifies a protocol family or
	instance of a protocol. Classes:

	IN	internet system
	CH	chaos system

TTL	The time to live of the RR. 32 bit integer in seconds. Used
	primarily by resolvers that cache RRs.

RDATA	Sometimes class dependent data that describes the resource:
	
	A	For the IN class, a 32 bit IP
		For the CH class, a domain name followed by a
		16 bit octal chaos address
	CNAME	a domain name
	MX	a 16 bit preference value (lower is better)
		followed by a host
	NS	a host name
	PTR	a domain name
	SOA	several fields


UDP query structure
The message format has a header with a number of fixed fields which are
always present,and four sections which carry query parameters and RRs.
The most important field in the header is a four bit field called an opccode.
Of the 16 possible values (0000, 0001, 0010, ..., 1111) one (standard query)
is a prt of the official protocol, two (inverse and status query) are options,
one (completion) is obsolete, and the rest are unassigned.
The four sections are:

Question	Carries the query name and other query parameters.
Answer		Carries RRs which directly answer the query.
Authority	Carries RRs which describe other authoritative servers.
		May optionally carry the SOA RR for the authoritative
		data in the answer section (hrmmmm.....).
Additional	Carries RRs which may be helpful in using the RRs in
		the other sections.

Note: the content, but not the format, of these sections varies with the
header opcode.

A standard query specifies a target domain (QNAME), query type (QTYPE),
and a query class (QCLASS) and asks for RRs that match. QTYPE and QCLASS
are each 16 bit fields and are a superset of defined types and classes.

QTYPE may contain:
<any type>	matches only that type (eg, A, PTR, etc.).
AXFR		zone xfer QTYPE
MAILB		matches all mail box related RRs (eg, MB and MG)
*		matches all RR types.

QCLASS may contain:
<any class>	matches only that class (eg, IN, CH).
*		matches all RR classes.

Example - a mailer using the local resolver to look up an MX record to send
mail to someone at stclair@biggiesize.com. The query would look like:
QNAME=biggiesize.com, QTYPE=MX, QCLASS=IN. The response's answer section
would look like:

	BIGGIESIZE.COM.	MX	10 drevil.biggiesize.com.

with an additional section providing the A record for the mail exchanger:

	DREVIL.BIGGIESIZE.COM.	A	63.113.219.2


Inverse queries
These are optional, however all name servers must be able to recognize the
inverse query and return a not-implemented error message. See rfc1035
for more info on inverse queries.

Status queries
Experimental, to be defined(????).

Completion queries
Obsolete. Redesigned services may be available in the future, or the opcodes
may be reclaimed. Hrmmm......


Resolver functions
Host name to host address translation: takes a char string, returns one
or more 32 bit IP addresses. Sends a request for type A RRs. 
Host address to host name translation: takes a 32 bit IP, returns a
char string. Octets of the IP are reversed, used as name components, and
suffixed with "IN-ADDR.ARPA". Sends a request for type PTR RRs.
See gethostbyname() and gethostbyaddr()

Example query structure:

QNAME=MOQUIJO.COM, QTYPE=A

               +---------------------------------------------------+
    Header     | OPCODE=SQUERY, RD                                 |
               +---------------------------------------------------+
    Question   | QNAME=MOQUIJO.COM., QCLASS=IN, QTYPE=A            |
               +---------------------------------------------------+
    Answer     | <empty>                                           |

               +---------------------------------------------------+

What if we modify the "Answer", "Authority", and "Additional" fields in
a query with no response opcode set in the header?

Example response:

               +---------------------------------------------------+
    Header     | OPCODE=SQUERY, RESPONSE, AA                       |
               +---------------------------------------------------+
    Question   | QNAME=MOQUIJO.COM., QCLASS=IN, QTYPE=A            |
               +---------------------------------------------------+
    Answer     | MOQUIJO.COM. 86400 IN A 65.24.1.36                |
               +---------------------------------------------------+
    Authority  | <empty>                                           |
               +---------------------------------------------------+
    Additional | <empty>                                           |
               +---------------------------------------------------+

Note the response and authoritative answer bits are set.


An example response if the QTYPE was *:

From rfc1035

Size limimts
labels		63 octets or less (1 octet = 1 byte)
names		255 octets or less
TTL		positive values of a signed 32 bit int
UDP messages	512 octets or less

Domain names in messages are expressed in terms of a sequence of labels.
Each label is represented as a one octet length field followed by that
number of octets.  Since every domain name ends with the null label of
the root, a domain name is terminated by a length byte of zero.  The
high order two bits of every length octet must be zero, and the
remaining six bits of the length field limit the label to 63 octets or
less. (OK, so what happens if those two HO bits aren't zero?)

To simplify implementations, the total length of a domain name (i.e.,
label octets and label length octets) is restricted to 255 octets or
less.

NAME		the name of the node to which this RR pertains.
TYPE		two bytes containing one of the RR TYPE codes.
CLASS		two bytes containing one of the RR CLASS codes.
TTL		32 bit signed int. SOA records should be zero to 
		prohibit caching.
RDLENGTH	unsigned 16 bit int specifying the length of bytes
		in the RDATA field.
RDATA		variable length string of bytes describing the
		resource. Format varies according to TYPE and
		CLASS of the RR.

TYPE fields in RRs (these are a subset of QTYPE, so all are valid QTYPEs):

A	1	host address
NS	2	authoritative server
MD	3	mail destination (obsolete - use MX)
MF	4	mail forwarder (obsolete - use MX)
CNAME	5	alias
SOA	6	start of a zone of authority

WKS	11	well known service desc.
PTR	12	domain name pointer
HINFO	13	host information
MINFO	14	mailbox or mail list information
MX	15	mail exchanger
TXT	16	text strings

QTYPE fields appear in the question part of a query:

AXFR	252	request for a zone xfer
MAILB	253	request for mailbox related records (MB, MG, or MR)
MAILA	254	request for mail agent RRs (obsolete, use MX)
*	255	request for all records


CLASS fields also appear in RRs (subset of QCLASS, so all valid QCLASSs):

IN	1	the Internet
CS	2	the CSNET class (obsolete, used only for examples in old rfcs)
CH	3	the CHAOS class
HS	4	Hesiod

QCLASS fields appear in the question section of the query:

*	255	any class
